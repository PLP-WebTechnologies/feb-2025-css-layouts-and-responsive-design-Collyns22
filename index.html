        <h2>Be Kind</h2>
        <p>
          We won’t see change and inspire people to think twice about their
          words and actions by using disrespectful, condescending, or hateful
          words to confront wrongdoing. If we are to inspire change, we must be
          the change. We must demonstrate how to respond to unkind behavior by
          ourselves being kind. Standing up with kindness can be firm. It can
          sometimes be loud. And it can even be hard to hear…because sometimes
          the truth hurts. But kindness is always respectful..

        <h2>Always Tell The Truth</h2>
        <p>
          Be willing to make the first move and even look foolish. Your truth
          requires you to be naked, but that doesn’t mean you’re unsafe. Again,
          your truth is your power. So open up, dig deep, and be honest.

        <h2>Trust In God</h2>
        <p>
          lorem 20 Trusting God is one of those truths we think we understand
          until we are called upon to do it, and then we discover that there is
          more to it than we realized. Trusting God is an aspect of saving faith
          which has been said to have three elements to it: knowledge, assent,
          and trust (cf. John Gill, Body of Divinity, vol. 1 [Grand Rapids:
          Baker Book House, 1978], 411)

        <p>
          To write effective and maintainable code, prioritize readability, use
          meaningful names, follow coding standards, and document your code
          thoroughly, while also focusing on modularity, efficiency, and
          testing.
